No more broadcast - only multicasts. Easier summarization. Can be run without a DHCP server. IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) - Assigns IP blocks to RIR (Regional Internet Registry - ARIN, RIPE, AFRINIC, APNIC, LACNIC.

There is no broadcast - only Unicast and Multicast. Global Unicast addresses Routable public addresses Link-local addresses : Addresses used in links directly. Routers will not route those packets. Addresses will always start FE80:0000:0000:0000 (FE80:/10) 64-bit interface identifier - EUI-64 process EUI-64 Process Take MAC address of the interface 11-22-33-aa-bb-cc Divide in half and insert FFFE. 11-22-33-FF-FE-AA-BB-CC 1122:33FF:FEAA:BBCC Do the bit inversion (invert the 7th bit of the address) 1122:33FF:FEAA:BBCC --> 1322:33FF:FEAA:BBCC Use EUI-64 process for global unicast address. ipv6 address 2001:1111:2222:1::/64 eui-64 IPv6 NDP - Neighbor Discovery Process Allows IPv6 enabled device to discover hosts and routers on an IPv6 enabled network. The discovery process is different for routers and hosts. NDP - Router Discovery Hosts multicast packet - Router Solicitation (RS) message - Destination address FF02::2 - All-IPv6-Routers address Routers receives RS on FF02::2 and sends RA (Router Advertisement). If the soliciting node HAS an IPv6 address --> RA is unicast to the host. If the soliciting node DOES NOT have an IPv6 address --> RA is sent to FF02::1 - \"All-IPV6-Nodes\" RA are also sent to FF02::1 every 200 seconds. FF02::1 --> All IPv6 hosts. NDP - Host Discovery NS --> Neighbor Solicitation. NA --> Neighbor Advertisement. NA is sent to SNMA - Solicited-node multicast address. Always begin with FF02::1:FF Contains the last 6 HEX characters of the interface mac address. That way only the relevant hosts will receive the requested NA. Host that receives the NA, add the entry to the NDP table - same purpose as the ARP table. DHCP and IPv6 Same basic functionality as IPv4 but two different types of DHCPv6 servers : Stateful and Stateless. Stateful DHCP SARR (instead of DORA) Solicit - Client Advertise - Server offers the address to the Client Request - Client request the previously offered lease to the server Reply - The Server confirms the lease to the client Stateful DHCP does not send \"Default Gateway\" in the DHCP lease. That part is discovered during the NDP process with NA and NS messages. Stateless DHCP Stateless autoconfiguration - SLAAC. Hosts will generate their own ip addresses from information received during the RA - RS process. RA messages will contain the subnet prefix and the prefix length. The host will then create it's own IP address adding it's own interface identifier at the end. IPv6 - Duplicate Address Detection - DAD Prevents duplicate addresses from being used on the network. 1. The host will send an NS (with the source address all :: - 128 zeros - unspecified ipv6 address) to the address it wants to use to FF02::1 (All IPV6 nodes) 2. If it gets a response, it means that a host is already using that address. IPv6 Packet Header Version : Set to 6 Traffic class : Replaces \"Type of Service\". Allow level of importance with QOS. Flow Label: NEW FIELD - Allow traffic priorities and categorization. Works with QOS and Traffic Class. Payload Length: Total length of packet Hop Limit : Like the TTL field of IPv4. Each hope decreases the counter by 1. Next Header : Equivalent to the Protocol field. Source Address : Source Address of the packet Destination Address : Destination Address of the packet Logging and Timestamps Change the aspect and format of timestamps for SYSLOG and DEBUG message. service timestamps log datetime !### Add year to log timestamps. service timestamps log datetime year !### Add millisecond to log timestamps. service timestamps log datetime msec service timestamps log datetime year msec show-timezone Logging to remote server Enable logging to the console. logging console Enable buffered logging.
